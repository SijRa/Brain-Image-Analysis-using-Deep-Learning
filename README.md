## Brain Image Analysis using Deep Learning
A multimodal deep learning approach to the early prediction of mild cognitive impairment conversion to Alzheimer's Disease.
## Overview
This project contains the code for the convolutional neural network - MudNet that identifies AD-converters and their risk of conversion within a 24 months.
* train.py defines that model training parameters
